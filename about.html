<p>My favorite things to do are softball, drawing, and going outside. Softball is something I'm really good at and it's really fun. My position is the pitcher, but sometimes I go on 1st base or center field. Drawing is one of my talents, and I could do it all day. I am wanting to be an artist when I grow up. I want people to see my artwork and tell me what they think about it. I love gazing at the sky or just walking and looking at nature. I like to be adventuress and explore the outdoors.  </p>
